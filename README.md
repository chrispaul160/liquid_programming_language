# Liquid Programming Language
Custom programming language built on top of Python. Shout out to CodePulse for the amazing tutorial! Check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUVahoidFA7F3Asfvamrm7w


Currently in the works right now. If/then loops are still broken. The rest should be funcitonal for the most part. There isn't very much of a computational advantage to using liquid vs any other programming language. This was just a project for me to study more about tokenizing, computational lexicology, parsing, etc.
